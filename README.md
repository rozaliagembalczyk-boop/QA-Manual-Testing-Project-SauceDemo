# QA-Manual-Testing-Project-SauceDemo
This project presents a complete manual testing process conducted on the SauceDemo web application (https://www.saucedemo.com/ ).  The objective of this project was to simulate real Quality Assurance work by designing, executing, and documenting functional test cases for a web-based e-commerce application.


## Functional Testing of SauceDemo Web Application

## 1. Executive Summary

This project presents a structured manual testing initiative conducted on the SauceDemo web application ([https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)).

The purpose of the project was to simulate a real-world Quality Assurance engagement by designing, executing, and documenting functional test scenarios aligned with professional QA standards.

The project demonstrates a structured testing approach, attention to detail, and the ability to document and assess application behavior systematically.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective was to validate the core functional components of a web-based e-commerce platform and ensure that key user flows operate as expected.

The testing focused on:

* Authentication mechanisms
* Product selection and cart management
* Checkout workflow
* Navigation and session handling
* Input validation and negative scenarios

---

## 3. Scope of Testing

### In Scope

* Login functionality (positive and negative test cases)
* Product listing and sorting features
* Cart functionality (add/remove items)
* Checkout process and form validation
* Order confirmation workflow
* Logout and session validation

### Out of Scope

* Performance testing
* Security testing
* Automation testing
* Cross-browser compatibility testing

## 4. Test Methodology

Testing was conducted using a structured manual testing approach, including:

1. Definition of test scenarios based on user workflows
2. Preparation of detailed test cases in Excel format
3. Execution of test cases with documentation of actual outcomes
4. Classification of test results (PASS / FAIL / NOT EXECUTED)
5. Identification and documentation of defects
6. Prioritization of test cases based on business impact

A total of **42 functional and negative test cases** were designed and executed.

## 5. Documentation and Deliverables

The following deliverables were prepared:

* Test Plan document
* Test Case register (Excel format)
* Bug Report log
* Supporting screenshots
* Execution status tracking
* Priority categorization (High / Medium / Low)

All documentation follows structured QA documentation standards to ensure traceability and clarity.

---

## 6. Tools and Environment

* Microsoft Excel – Test case documentation and execution tracking
* Web Browser (Google Chrome) – Test execution
* Manual functional testing methodology

Testing was performed on a desktop environment.

---

## 7. Key Competencies Demonstrated

This project demonstrates:

* Structured analytical thinking
* Ability to design and execute functional test scenarios
* Clear documentation of expected vs actual system behavior
* Understanding of negative testing principles
* Prioritization based on business impact
* Professional QA documentation practices

---

## 8. Conclusion

This project reflects a practical understanding of manual Quality Assurance processes within a structured framework. It demonstrates the ability to assess system functionality, identify potential defects, and document findings in a clear and professional manner.
